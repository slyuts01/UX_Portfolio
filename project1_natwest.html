      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>NatWest is a UK-based bank that provides personal, private, and business banking services to over 12.5 million customers in England and Wales, and large corporates in Western Europe. With a proud history of innovation, including the launch of the Switch debit card and pioneering the growth of cash machines, NatWest is also committed to financial education through its MoneySense programme for young people. The NatWest mobile banking app is used by over 5 million customers each day, with more than 1.8 billion log-ins every year, offering features such as balance and transaction checks, quick payments, and secure messaging with the bank's 24/7 customer service.</p>
		  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>So, I recently switched to NatWest bank from one of those cool fintech banks, and boy, was I in for a surprise! I got so used to having all those awesome features in my old banking app, but when I started using NatWest's app, it felt like something was missing. That got me thinking: do other NatWest users feel the same way? And can I do something about it to make the app better for all of us?</p>

<p>So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and set out on a little mission. The challenge was clear – find out what's bugging other users about the NatWest Mobile banking app. I knew if I wanted to make a real difference, I needed to understand exactly what people were struggling with.</p>

<p>Here's what I wanted to explore:</p>

<p><strong class="highlight_p">Biometrics Hassles:</strong> You know those fingerprint and facial recognition logins? Well, I wanted to see if they were causing any headaches for folks and find out if there were any hiccups during the authentication process.</p>

<p><strong class="highlight_p">Navigational Maze:</strong> The app's navigation had me scratching my head at times. I wanted to figure out if others were getting lost too and if certain parts of the app were just not as user-friendly as they could be.</p>

<p><strong class="highlight_p">Missing Notifications:</strong> One thing that bugged me was the absence of push notifications for incoming payments. I wondered if others missed them too and if that affected their money management.</p>

<p><strong class="highlight_p">Statement Download Dilemma:</strong> So, there's no direct option to download statements in the app. I wondered how people were coping with that and if it was something they really wanted.</p>

<p>My goal was to use this research to propose a revamped NatWest Mobile banking app that would fix these issues. I wanted to make sure it was a breeze to use, biometrics were smooth, navigation made sense, notifications kept users in the loop, and getting statements was a piece of cake.</p>

<p>This case study will dig into the user research I did, spill the beans on what NatWest users had to say, and lay out my killer plan to make the app rock! I'm all about improving the app experience for everyone, and I hope this redesign will put smiles on our faces and make banking with NatWest a real pleasure. Let's do this! 🚀</p>

The new information architecture focused on categorizing features logically, ensuring easy access to frequently used functions. The main menu was organized into clear sections, such as "Accounts," "Payments," "Cards," "Statements," and "Settings," making it easier for users to find what they need quickly.</p>

<h3>2. Viewing and Downloading Statements</h3>

<p>Under the "Statements" section, I added a dedicated feature that allows users to view and download their account statements directly within the app. Users can access their transaction history and select a specific time frame to generate and download the statement in PDF format. This feature provides users with a convenient way to access their financial records, eliminating the need to resort to alternative methods.</p>

<h3>3. Card Details Management</h3>

<p>Under the new "manage My Card" section, I introduced a feature that empowers users to manage their bank cards' details securely. Users can now view essential card information, such as card number, expiration date, and account balance. To ensure security, I implemented two-factor authentication, allowing users to access this sensitive information either by using their fingerprint or by entering their app password.</p>

<h3>4. Access to Card PIN and Copy Card Details</h3>

<p>Within the "Card Details Management" feature, users can now view their card's PIN securely, removing the need for face recognition for this purpose. Additionally, I added a "Copy Card Details" option, which allows users to copy their card information quickly for online transactions or reference without compromising security.

      <h2>Second Usability Test</h2>
		<p>During the second usability test, users interacted with the fully designed Natwest Mobile banking app and provided feedback on its functionality and user experience. The results were overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing high satisfaction with the redesigned app. They appreciated the user-friendly interface, improved navigation, and the addition of new features like biometric login, statements access, and card management.</p>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>The redesign of the Natwest Mobile banking app was a rewarding and fulfilling experience. By following a user-centered design process, I successfully identified pain points and user needs through research, developed user personas to empathize with the target audience, and generated creative solutions during the ideation phase.</p>

<p>The usability testing played a crucial role in validating the design decisions and provided valuable feedback to refine the prototypes and final designs. The positive response from users in both usability tests reinforced the effectiveness of the redesign and highlighted the importance of understanding user needs in creating a successful app.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, I constantly reminded myself of the importance of creating a seamless and delightful user experience. I learned that by putting users at the center of the design process and continuously iterating based on their feedback, I was able to create a product that resonated with the audience.</p>

<p>Overall, the Natwest Mobile banking app redesign was a great learning experience that emphasized the significance of empathy, creativity, and user feedback in crafting products that cater to users' needs and preferences. The positive user feedback and increased user satisfaction reaffirmed the impact of a well-executed user-centered design approach. I am proud of the outcome and excited to see how the redesigned app will positively impact Natwest app users' banking experience.</p>
